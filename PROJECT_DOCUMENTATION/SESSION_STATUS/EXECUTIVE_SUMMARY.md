---

## KEY FINDINGS

### 1. Claude Code 2.0 Has Strong Agentic Foundations

**Critical Capabilities Identified**:
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Explore sub-agent (Haiku 4.5) for rapid codebase search
- ✅ **Sonnet Plan Mode**: Sonnet 4.5 planning + Haiku 4.5 execution = smart + fast
- ✅ **Context Management**: Checkpoints, micro-compact, manual compact for long sessions
- ✅ **Interactive Questions**: Configurable human gates at decision points
- ✅ **Skills System**: Progressive disclosure of QuantConnect knowledge
- ✅ **Plugin System**: Custom workflow commands
- ✅ **Agent SDK**: Build fully custom autonomous agents

**Model Capabilities**:
- **Sonnet 4.5**: Best coding model (SWE-bench), 30+ hour focus on complex tasks
- **Haiku 4.5**: 2x faster, 1/3 cost of Sonnet 4, similar performance
- **Opus 4.1**: Premium for most demanding tasks (GPQA-Val leader)

### 2. Autonomous Workflow Is Achievable

**Five-Phase Autonomous Cycle**:
1. **Research** → Generate and rank 3-5 hypotheses
2. **Implementation** → Code algorithm with QuantConnect Lean framework
3. **Backtest** → Execute, analyze results, detect overfitting
4. **Optimization** → Parameter tuning with robustness checks
5. **Validation** → Out-of-sample testing, generalization analysis

**Decision Framework**: Clear rules for autonomous routing between phases based on:
- Performance thresholds (Sharpe, drawdown, trade count)
- Overfitting detection (too-perfect results, parameter sensitivity)
- Technical failures (errors, bugs, data issues)
- Iteration limits (cost, attempts, context)

**Iteration Loop**: Can autonomously test 2-3 hypotheses per session with proper context management.

### 3. Three Critical Customizations Required

**Must Build**:
1. **QuantConnect Skill** (CRITICAL)
   - Teaches Lean Algorithm Framework patterns
   - Progressive disclosure (loaded on-demand)
   - Examples, templates, best practices
   - **Priority**: Build first

2. **Strategy Development Plugin** (HIGH)
   - Custom commands: /qc-init, /qc-backtest, /qc-optimize, /qc-validate, /qc-auto-iterate
   - Hooks: Auto-checkpoint, context warnings
   - State management: iteration_state.json, decision logging
   - **Priority**: Build second for workflow automation

3. **QuantConnect Agent via SDK** (MEDIUM)
   - Fully autonomous orchestration
   - Python decision engine
   - Async operations, parallel backtests
   - Real-time monitoring
   - **Priority**: Build third for production-grade system

### 4. Context Management Is Critical

**Challenge**: Long autonomous tasks can exceed 200K token limit.

**Solution**: Multi-layered strategy:
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Load skills/files only when needed
- **External State Files**: iteration_state.json, results in CSVs/JSONs
- **Micro-Compact**: Auto-clears large tool results
- **Manual Compact**: At phase transitions
- **Checkpoints**: Safe exploration with rewind capability

**Budget**: 50-90K tokens per hypothesis with good management = 2-3 hypotheses per session.

### 5. Gaps and Limitations Identified

**Current Gaps**:
- ❌ No native QuantConnect knowledge (need Skill)
- ❌ No built-in workflow automation (need Plugin)
- ❌ No parallel backtest execution (workaround: background Bash)
- ❌ No visualization (equity curves, heatmaps)
- ❌ No persistent memory across sessions (external files required)

**Workarounds Available**:
- ✅ Custom Python wrapper scripts (qc_backtest.py)
- ✅ Background Bash execution + BashOutput monitoring
- ✅ State persistence via JSON/CSV files
- ✅ Text-based analysis instead of visualizations

## DECISION FRAMEWORK HIGHLIGHTS

### Autonomous Decision Rules

**After Backtest**:
```
IF sharpe > 3.0 OR trades < 10 OR win_rate > 80%:
    → ESCALATE (overfitting likely)
ELIF sharpe >= 1.0 AND drawdown <= 20%:
    → PROCEED_TO_VALIDATION
ELIF sharpe >= 0.7 AND optimization_attempts < 3:
    → PROCEED_TO_OPTIMIZATION
ELIF sharpe < 0.5:
    → ABANDON_HYPOTHESIS
```

**After Optimization**:
```
IF improvement > 30%:
    → ASK_USER (suspicious improvement)
ELIF parameter_sensitivity > 0.5:
    → USE_ROBUST_PARAMS (median of top quartile)
ELIF improvement > 5%:
    → PROCEED_TO_VALIDATION (with optimized params)
ELSE:
    → PROCEED_TO_VALIDATION (with baseline params)
```

**After Validation**:
```
IF oos_degradation > 50%:
    → RETRY_OPTIMIZATION (walk-forward) OR ABANDON
ELIF oos_degradation > 30%:
    → ASK_USER (significant degradation)
ELIF oos_sharpe >= 1.0:
    → STRATEGY_COMPLETE
ELSE:
    → STRATEGY_VALIDATED_SUBOPTIMAL (document, continue research)
```

### Human Intervention Modes

**Minimal Autonomy**: Human approval at hypothesis selection, final validation
**Medium Autonomy**: Human approval at hypothesis selection only
**Full Autonomy**: Human approval only for deployment

## CONTEXT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Per-Phase Budget

| Phase | Tokens | Actions |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Research | 30-50K | Compact after completion |
| Implementation | 40-60K | Micro-compact handles code |
| Backtest | 40-70K | Externalize results immediately |
| Optimization | 60-90K | Compact after (heaviest phase) |
| Validation | 30-50K | Compact after completion |

### External File Structure

```
strategy_research/
├── iteration_state.json        # Current state (small, always in context)
├── hypotheses_log.md           # All hypotheses (reference only)
├── decisions_log.md            # All decisions (audit trail)
├── backtest_results/           # Full outputs (read as needed)
├── strategies/                 # All code (write once, reference)
└── analysis/                   # Comparisons, reports
```

### Key Principles

1. **Keep only summaries in context** (Sharpe, drawdown, decision)
2. **Externalize all large data** (full backtest JSONs, optimization CSVs)
3. **Compact at phase transitions** (not mid-phase)
4. **Monitor proactively** (/context before each phase)
5. **Use progressive disclosure** (skills, files loaded on-demand)

**Result**: 2-3 hypotheses per session vs 1 without management.

- Evaluate other autonomous systems

---

## CONCLUSION

**Claude Code 2.0 is well-suited for autonomous QuantConnect strategy development** with three critical customizations:

1. **QuantConnect Skill** (teach Lean framework)
2. **Strategy Development Plugin** (workflow automation)
3. **QuantConnect Agent** (optional, production-grade)

The **recommended path** is:

1. **Validate** (Week 1-2): Build Skill + wrapper, test manually → **START HERE**
2. **Automate** (Week 3-4): Build plugin with commands
3. **Deploy** (Week 5-8): Implement full autonomous loop
4. **Enhance** (Week 9-12): Build Agent SDK version (optional)

**Expected Outcome**:
- **8 weeks** to fully autonomous system
- **$200-500** development investment
- **$220/month** ongoing cost (Claude Max 20X + QuantConnect)
- **2-3 hypotheses per session** tested autonomously
- **1-2 validated strategies** per research cycle
- **<$20 per validated strategy** at scale

**Key Success Factor**: Validate the workflow manually first (Week 1-2) before investing in automation. This de-risks the entire approach.
