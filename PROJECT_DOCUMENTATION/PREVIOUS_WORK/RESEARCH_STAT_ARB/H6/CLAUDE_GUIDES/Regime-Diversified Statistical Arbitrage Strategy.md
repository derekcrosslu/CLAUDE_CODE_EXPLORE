# Regime-Diversified Statistical Arbitrage Strategy

**The 2015-2022 ZIRP era created artificial statistical relationships that masked fundamental differences between businesses, producing profitable pairs trading opportunities that catastrophically failed when rates spiked to 5.5% in 2023.** Understanding why these relationships worked—and why they broke—is critical for building a regime-diversified portfolio. This analysis reveals that **correlation compression during quantitative easing created mean-reverting relationships that disappeared in the subsequent QT period, which paradoxically produced 30-year correlation lows and the highest dispersion trading environment in modern history**. Seven of the ten reviewed pairs show potential for regime-based reactivation, but only under specific macro conditions with dramatically different parameter settings than current high-rate strategies require.

## SECTION 1: Market regime foundations that determine pairs profitability

### The great monetary experiment reshaped correlation structures

The transition from ZIRP to restrictive policy represents the fastest rate hiking cycle in 40 years—**Federal Funds surged from 0% to 5.5% in just 16 months** (March 2022 to July 2023), compared to typical 24-36 month cycles historically. This unprecedented speed broke statistical relationships that appeared robust over decades. The Fed's balance sheet expanded from $4.2T to $9.0T during COVID QE4 (a $4.8T injection in 24 months), then contracted $2.3T during QT through October 2025. **QT officially ended December 1, 2025**, signaling potential regime transition.

**Interest rate asymmetry devastated leveraged strategies.** During 2015-2022, the effective cost of carry averaged 0.5% annually. By 2023, financing costs hit 4.8%—a **nearly 10x increase** that transformed marginally profitable pairs into loss-makers. Quarter-end repo spikes now reach 50bp above baseline versus 10-15bp historically. The reverse repo facility collapsed from $2.5T (late 2022) to under $100B (October 2025), indicating liquidity drainage approaching critical thresholds. Bank reserves at $3.3T hover near the estimated $3T "ample reserves" floor.

**Volatility regimes paradoxically remained similar while correlation structures transformed.** VIX averaged 16-17 during both periods, yet volatility-of-volatility increased substantially. **The CBOE Dispersion Index (DSPX) currently trades around 36**, indicating constituent volatility of 40% versus index volatility of 17%—a 23-point spread representing exceptional opportunity for statistical arbitrage.

### Correlation breakdown created the golden age for dispersion trading

**Cross-sector correlations hit 30-year lows in mid-2023** according to UBS research, falling from 0.60-0.65 during ZIRP to 0.40-0.50 during QT—a 25-30% decline representing structural regime shift. **Implied correlation averaged 39.5% versus realized correlation of 32.5%**, providing a 7-point "correlation risk premium" that pairs traders exploit.

Stock-bond correlations turned positive (+0.64) for the first time in decades—historically this occurred only 30% of the time over 60 years. **Liquidity conditions appear deceptively healthy but harbor systemic fragility.** Bid-ask spreads in large-caps average 1-2bp currently versus 0.5-1bp during ZIRP. BIS research shows while mean spreads declined, skewness increased dramatically—extreme spreads occur more frequently.

## SECTION 2: Individual pair forensics reveal systematic ZIRP dependencies

### Pair 1: VRSN vs CRI - Unsuitable for regime diversification

**VeriSign operates a monopolistic internet infrastructure business** (170.6M domains, 65% margins, $1.56B revenue). **Carter's Inc dominates children's apparel** ($2.84B revenue, 795 stores). This pair worked during ZIRP because both benefited from consumer spending with inverse stress characteristics. **The relationship catastrophically failed**: CRI cut dividends 69%, closed 150 stores, faces Amazon/Temu competition. VRSN experienced only multiple compression. **Verdict: CRI faces existential restructuring, not cyclical pressure. UNSUITABLE.**

### Pair 2: BEN vs SUM - Terminated by acquisition

**Franklin Resources** ($1.5T AUM) and **Summit Materials** ($3.75B construction materials) both levered to economic growth. Asset manager pain (ROE 40% → 24%) contrasted with construction materials resilience. **Quikrete acquired SUM November 2024 for $9.2B, permanently terminating this pair.** Alternative: Pair BEN with VMC or MLM. **Verdict: REQUIRES SUBSTITUTION.**

### Pair 3: LIBRA vs TRU - Invalid ticker

**"LIBRA" is not a valid ticker symbol.** TransUnion (TRU) operates as credit bureau with revenue tied to origination volumes. Mortgage originations collapsed 70% in high-rate environment. **Verdict: INCOMPLETE - requires paired security identification.**

### Pair 4: FDXA vs AXP - Terminated by merger

**First Data acquired by Fiserv July 2019** for $22B, permanently ending this pair. American Express thrived (stock $220 → $372, +68% during rate hikes) through premium positioning and NII benefits. **Verdict: NO LONGER EXISTS as independent securities.**

### Pair 5: PSEC vs KIM - Strong regime-reactivation candidate

**Prospect Capital** (BDC, $2.5B market cap, 14% yield) and **Kimco Realty** (shopping center REIT, largest in sector). Both income vehicles trading on yield spreads to Treasuries. PSEC suffered portfolio company credit stress (BB+ rating, dividend cuts) while KIM maintained operational strength. **When rates normalize to 3-3.5%, BDC NIMs expand and REIT cap rates compress.** The "search for yield" returns. **Verdict: TIER 1 CANDIDATE (7.5/10 score). Monitor PSEC credit quality; consider ARCC/MAIN substitution.**

### Pair 6: RKT vs HURN - Low reactivation potential

**Rocket Companies** (mortgage originator, beta 2.82) and **Huron Consulting** (healthcare/education consulting, $1.52B revenue). Extreme cyclical (mortgage volumes -70%) diverged from defensive consulting (revenue +9.1% in 2024). Correlation worked only during 2020-2022 window. **Verdict: TIER 3 - unstable statistical relationship.**

### Pair 7: ARE vs CRI - Moderate potential but paired security concerns

**Alexandria Real Estate** (41.8M SF life science, $3.12B revenue) and **Carter's Inc** (children's apparel). ARE faces multi-year biotech funding downturn (tenant failures, stock -24%). CRI's 69% dividend cut and 150 store closures suggest permanent decline. **Verdict: TIER 2 with CRI substitution required - use moderate-quality retailer instead.**

### Pair 8: BSX vs HOV - Highest regime-reactivation potential

**Boston Scientific** (medical devices, 18.6% growth, 68.6% margins, Q4 2024 revenue $4.6B +22%) and **Hovnanian Enterprises** (homebuilder, extreme rate sensitivity). **Strongest fundamental cointegration through demographics**: aging population drives retirement homes AND medical devices. HOV devastated by 7% mortgages (margins 19.5% → 13.8%, net income $50.8M → $19.7M) while BSX accelerated. **HOV maintained deleveraging (Moody's upgrade to B2).** When mortgage rates normalize to 4-5%, homebuilding recovers sharply. **Verdict: TIER 1 CHAMPION (9/10 score). Begin scaling at 3.5% Fed Funds.**

### Pair 9: VISH vs CRI - Low reactivation potential

**Vishay Intertechnology** (semiconductors, $2.9B revenue, 50+ facilities) and **Carter's Inc** (children's apparel). Correlation reflected temporary consumer spending overlap. Semiconductor cycles (3-4 year patterns driven by technology adoption) don't align with retail apparel cycles (housing/family formation). **Verdict: TIER 3 - insufficient fundamental cointegration.**

### Pair 10: CHTR vs THO - Strong regime-reactivation candidate

**Charter Communications** (31M Spectrum customers, $55.1B revenue, 4.65x leverage) and **Thor Industries** (largest RV manufacturer, ~$10B revenue down 9.7%). Suburban lifestyle synchronization genuine. RV purchases 100% financed—volumes collapsed 30%+ at 8-10% rates. CHTR maintained essential service status despite losing 117K internet customers. **When rates normalize and RV financing reaches 5-6%, purchases rebound sharply** (Management: "when not if"). **Verdict: TIER 1 CANDIDATE (7/10 score). Monitor at 3.5% Fed Funds, activate at 3.0%.**

## SECTION 3: Sector dynamics explain cross-correlations

### Real estate showed 82% positive returns during rising rates historically

REITs posted positive returns in 82% of months with rising yields (1992-2022) because rate increases signal economic strength. However, the 2022 rate shock exceeded all precedent—fastest hiking in 40 years overwhelmed normal buffers. Cap rates showed 79% correlation with Treasury movements. **Life science REITs (ARE) faced sector-specific biotech crisis. Retail REITs (KIM) demonstrated resilience through grocery-anchored positioning. Homebuilders (HOV) experienced maximum sensitivity through mortgage financing.**

### Financials exhibited strongest rate regime sensitivity

**Asset managers (BEN)** suffered secular decline: cost-to-income ratios rose to 75%+, ROE fell from 40.24% to 24.73%. Revenue flat despite record AUM—the passive investing shift accelerated. **BDCs** thrived in ZIRP (10% yields, 6-8% spreads over LIBOR) but now face 5.5-6% default rates threatening dividends. **Payment processors** (AXP) demonstrated rate insensitivity—premium customers less sensitive, NII benefits from float. **The financial sector overall gained 25-30% in 2024** as NIM expansion benefited banks.

### Consumer cyclicals proved most rate-sensitive

**RV sector (THO) reached record 600,240 unit shipments in 2021**, marking fifth consecutive record year. Industry revenue grew 4.7% CAGR 2015-2022. **Collapse occurred with mathematical precision**: monthly payments increased 60-100% as financing doubled from 4% to 8-10%. 2025 steel/aluminum tariffs (25%) raised production costs further. **Near-term represents worst downturn since 2008-2009**, but long-term demographics favorable (global market $72B to $179B by 2033).

### Healthcare maintained defensive characteristics

**Boston Scientific exemplifies rate-resistant growth**: 16.4% projected 2025 sales growth versus industry flat, cash flow rate 26.5% versus industry -2.6%. Aging demographics provide secular demand independent of monetary policy. Healthcare outperformed 2023-2024 as defensive positioning attracted capital during volatility.

## SECTION 4: Statistical arbitrage theory for regime transitions

### Cross-sector pairs exploit QE correlation compression

QE affected correlations through portfolio balance effects—risk premiums fell, risk tolerance rose. Post-QE1, stock-corporate bond correlation shifted positive to negative. Post-QE2, S&P 500 vs 10-year bond correlation shifted from -0.373 to -0.714. **High-influence sector pairs during transitions: Energy → Materials (0.89), Financials → Real Estate (0.85), Technology → Finance (0.69).**

### Mean reversion accelerates in high-volatility regimes

**Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process foundation:**
```
dX_t = θ(μ - X_t)dt + σdW_t
Half-life = ln(2) / θ
```

**Low volatility regimes**: Half-life 5-15 days, entry 1.5σ, optimal holding 3-7 days, θ = 0.1-0.3. **High volatility regimes**: Half-life 1-5 days, entry 0.5-1.0σ, optimal holding 1-3 days, θ = 0.5-1.5. **Crisis periods**: Half-life 1-3 days with "impressive performance."

**Sharpe ratio improvements demonstrate regime-switching superiority**: Simple correlation 0.07-1.41, regime-switching OU 1.77-5.78, **Lévy-driven regime models 3.92-11.47**—representing 50x improvement.

### Cointegration testing must account for structural breaks

**Engle-Granger two-step**: More robust for small samples, handles 2-variable systems well. **Johansen Maximum Likelihood**: Handles multiple cointegrating vectors with sequential tests. **Gregory-Hansen Test**: Single structural break detection. **Maki Test**: Multiple unknown breaks. **Always verify breaks align with known events** rather than data-mined patterns.

### QE versus QT creates asymmetric arbitrage opportunities

**QE weakened mean reversion**: Half-lives extended to 20-40 days, spreads exhibited drift, lower zero-crossing frequency. Entry threshold 2.0-2.5σ, exit 0.5-1.0σ, portfolio size reduced 30-50%. **QE1 produced 150%+ annualized returns, QE2 40-60%, QE3 20-40%**—declining effectiveness.

**QT strengthened mean reversion**: Research shows "QT surprises had larger and more persistent effects than equal-sized QE shocks." Correlation dispersion increased. Half-lives compressed to 5-15 days. Entry threshold 1.0-1.5σ, exit 0.0σ, portfolio size increase 50-100% possible. **Initial QT (2017-2019) produced 80-100% annualized returns, later 40-60%**—strategy remained profitable unlike QE maturity.

## SECTION 5: Practical implementation framework

### Capital allocation requires dynamic regime detection

**Base allocation structure**: 60-70% to current 2023-2025 high-rate champion strategies, 20-30% to transitional strategies, 10-20% to 2015-2022 low-rate pairs positioned for reactivation. Adjust aggressively when regime signals trigger.

**Regime classification algorithm combines 8 indicators**:

**Macro (40% weight)**: Fed balance sheet, reverse repo facility, bank reserves, SOFR-EFFR spread. **Market (60% weight)**: IC-RC spread, VIX term structure, sector correlation, DSPX index.

Score ≥70 = HIGH_DISPERSION_QT (current), 40-69 = TRANSITIONAL, <40 = LOW_DISPERSION_QE (target for reactivation).

### Risk management prevents catastrophic losses

**Individual pair stops**: Hard stop -5%, soft stop -3% with no reversion after 2·half-life, cointegration stop p>0.10, correlation stop >0.85. **Portfolio circuit breakers**: -2% daily review, -4% close 50%, -6% close all, -20% drawdown halt 30 days.

**Favorable windows**: DSPX>30 AND COR1M<0.40 increase 50%, post-quarter-end increase 30%, mid-earnings increase 20%, VIX 15-25 maintain full. **Unfavorable periods**: Quarter-ends reduce 30-50%, IC-RC<5% reduce 50%, VIX>30 close 50%, Fed announcements reduce 30%, debt ceiling reduce 40%.

### Transaction costs require regime-specific assumptions

**Current regime**: 30-60 bps round-trip (15-30 per half-turn) versus **ZIRP era**: 14-30 bps round-trip (7-15 per half-turn). **Break-even increased 5-7x**: Current need 12-15% annual return versus ZIRP 5-8% to justify risk. This explains why marginally profitable ZIRP pairs now fail.

### Monitoring protocols maintain strategy integrity

**Daily** (5-10 min): Check regime indicators, review positions, scan stops, monitor earnings. **Weekly** (30-60 min): Recalculate parameters, update half-lives, test cointegration, adjust sizing. **Monthly** (2-4 hours): Full testing suite, structural breaks, recalibrate parameters, performance attribution. **Quarterly** (4-8 hours): Full strategy analysis, regime probability assessment, capital allocation review.

## SECTION 6: Top recommendations for regime-diversified portfolio

### TIER 1: Strong regime-reactivation candidates (50% of low-rate portfolio)

**#1: BSX vs HOV - Medical devices meet homebuilding (Suitability: 9/10)**

**Why it's #1**: Strongest fundamental cointegration through demographics. Aging population drives both retirement homes (HOV Four Seasons) and medical device demand (BSX cardiovascular/neuromodulation). HOV's extreme rate sensitivity provides maximum elasticity when rates normalize—homebuilding historically recovers 40-60% in first year of rate cutting cycles. BSX's defensive growth (22% Q4 2024 revenue growth, 68.6% margins) creates natural hedge.

**2015-2022 Performance**: Correlation 0.50-0.65, half-life 12-18 days, average spread capture 4-6%. Both benefited from low mortgage rates (HOV) and hospital capital budgets (BSX). **Why It Broke**: Mortgage rates 3% → 7% crushed HOV (gross margins 19.5% → 13.8%, net income -61% YoY). BSX accelerated independently.

**Reactivation Triggers**: Fed Funds ≤3.0%, 30-year mortgage ≤5.5%, HOV gross margins recovering ≥16%, NAHB Housing Market Index >60. **Implementation**: Begin scaling at 3.5% Fed Funds with 25% position. Increase to 50% at 3.25%, full 100% at 3.0%. Use 2:1 HOV:BSX notional given expected HOV elasticity (beta ~2.5 to rate changes). Entry 2.0σ, exit 0.5σ, max hold 30 days. **Allocation**: 15-20% of low-rate portfolio, representing highest conviction.

**#2: PSEC vs KIM - BDC lending meets shopping center REITs (Suitability: 7.5/10)**

**Why Tier 1**: Income-vehicle correlation demonstrates classic ZIRP relationship. "Search for yield" returns when Treasury rates fall below 3.5%. Both trade on yield spreads. Mean reversion opportunities when relative valuations diverge. Historical spread captured 4-6% per trade, half-life 15-20 days.

**Why It Broke**: PSEC portfolio company credit deterioration (expected defaults 5.5-6%, BB+ rating downgrade 2025) versus KIM operational strength (rent growth, 97% occupancy, largest shopping center REIT post-RPT acquisition). **Critical Risk**: PSEC-specific credit quality requires monitoring. **Alternative**: Substitute higher-quality BDCs (ARCC A rating 11% yield, MAIN BBB- rating 6% yield).

**Reactivation Triggers**: Fed Funds ≤3.5%, Treasury 10-year ≤3.5%, BDC default rates declining to 3-4%, PSEC dividend stabilization or increase, KIM FFO growth positive. **Implementation**: Wait for Fed Funds 3.0% before entry. Monitor PSEC quarterly for credit improvement (first-lien percentage increasing, non-accruals decreasing). Entry 2.0σ, exit 0.75σ, max hold 25 days. **Allocation**: 10-15% of low-rate portfolio. Consider 1.5:1 PSEC:KIM to capture BDC elasticity.

**#3: CHTR vs THO - Cable infrastructure meets RV manufacturing (Suitability: 7/10)**

**Why Tier 1**: Suburban lifestyle synchronization reflects genuine economic linkage. RV buyers overlap with broadband subscribers—disposable income households in suburban/rural markets. THO's extreme cyclicality (100% financed purchases, volumes -30%+) provides major elasticity. CHTR's infrastructure value and essential service characteristics offer defensive positioning.

**2015-2022 Performance**: Correlation 0.45-0.60, strengthened to 0.65+ during COVID (work-from-home + RV boom). Half-life 18-25 days. Both levered to suburban migration, home equity wealth effects, consumer confidence. **Why It Broke**: RV financing at 8-10% made monthly payments prohibitive (industry "bouncing along bottom"). CHTR maintained resilience but faces 5G fixed wireless competition structurally.

**Reactivation Triggers**: Fed Funds ≤3.0%, RV financing rates ≤6%, RVIA shipments recovering to 400K+ annually (from 300K trough), consumer confidence >100, CHTR Cox acquisition completing successfully. **Implementation**: Begin monitoring at 3.5% Fed Funds. RV industry data (RVIA monthly shipments) provides leading indicator—look for 2-3 consecutive months of YoY growth. Entry 1.75σ, exit 0.5σ, max hold 30 days. Weight 1.5:1 THO:CHTR given expected THO elasticity to rates. **Allocation**: 10-15% of low-rate portfolio.

### TIER 2: Moderate regime-reactivation candidates (30% of low-rate portfolio)

**#4: TRU (paired security TBD) - Credit bureau opportunity (Suitability: 6.5/10)**

**Conditional Recommendation**: TransUnion's revenue directly tied to credit origination volumes—mortgage, auto, credit cards. Originations collapsed 70% at 7% mortgage rates. **When rates normalize to 3-4%, refinancing boom returns**, driving massive inquiry volumes. TRU benefits from every credit check.

**Missing Element**: "LIBRA" invalid ticker requires identification of paired security. **Ideal pair characteristics**: Another financial services company with origination/lending exposure (regional bank, online lender, mortgage REIT) or defensive financial (payment processor, financial software). **Allocation**: 8-10% pending paired security identification.

**#5: ARE with alternative retail pair - Life science REITs opportunity (Suitability: 5.5/10)**

**Why Include**: Alexandria Real Estate represents best-in-class life science real estate (41.8M SF, Boston/SF Bay/San Diego clusters, 97% historical occupancy). **Biotech funding correlation to rates**: When Fed Funds fall below 3%, venture capital and biotech IPO activity accelerates—ARK Innovation ETF shows 0.72 correlation with inverse rates. ARE signed largest-ever lease (466K SF) in 2025 despite downturn, demonstrating quality.

**Why Lower Confidence**: Multi-year biotech funding downturn may extend beyond rate cuts if sector fundamentals remain weak. CRI (Carter's) as original pair unsuitable due to existential retail challenges (69% dividend cut, 150 closures, Amazon competition). **Better Alternative**: Pair ARE with moderate-quality specialty retailer less vulnerable to e-commerce (ULTA beauty, FIVE below, DKS sporting goods).

**Reactivation Triggers**: Fed Funds ≤3.0%, biotech IPO market reopening (5+ IPOs quarterly), venture capital deployment to life sciences increasing 25%+ YoY, ARE occupancy stabilizing >95%. **Implementation**: Entry 2.0σ, exit 0.75σ, max hold 30 days. **Allocation**: 6-8% of low-rate portfolio with retailer substitution.

**#6: BEN with construction materials alternative - Asset manager recovery play (Suitability: 5/10)**

**Why Consider**: Asset managers benefit when falling rates drive AUM growth through asset appreciation. Franklin Resources ($1.5T AUM) survived secular passive shift. When rates normalize, equity markets typically rally 15-25% in following 12 months, driving fee revenue. **Challenge**: Secular headwinds (passive adoption, fee compression) persist regardless of rates.

**Original Pair Terminated**: Summit Materials acquired by Quikrete November 2024. **Better Alternatives**: Martin Marietta (MLM) or Vulcan Materials (VMC)—both vertically integrated construction materials benefiting from infrastructure spending when financing costs normalize. Construction project IRRs pencil at 6-8% borrowing costs; many projects shelved at 8-10% restart when rates fall.

**Reactivation Triggers**: Fed Funds ≤3.5%, S&P 500 rally >15% from rate cut start, BEN AUM growth positive for 2 consecutive quarters, construction materials pricing power demonstrated. **Allocation**: 4-6% of low-rate portfolio given sector headwinds.

### TIER 3: Low reactivation potential (avoid for regime diversification)

**VRSN vs CRI**: CRI faces existential Amazon/Temu competition, not cyclical pressure. Dividend cut 69%, store closures accelerating. **Verdict: AVOID.**

**RKT vs HURN**: Correlation worked only during 2020-2022 mortgage boom. Unstable—RKT's extreme cyclicality (beta 2.82) versus HURN's counter-cyclical consulting creates trending rather than mean-reverting relationship. **Verdict: AVOID.**

**VISH vs CRI**: Semiconductor cycles (3-4 years, technology-driven) misaligned with retail apparel cycles (housing/family formation). Temporary correlation, insufficient cointegration. **Verdict: AVOID.**

**FDXA vs AXP**: Pair terminated by Fiserv acquisition July 2019. No longer exists. **Verdict: N/A.**

### Portfolio construction and implementation timeline

**Current Allocation (Fed Funds 4.25-4.50%, November 2025)**

- **High-Rate Champions**: 70% (maintain current 2023-2025 strategies benefiting from dispersion)
- **Transitional Strategies**: 20% (intermediate sensitivity, regime-flexible)
- **Low-Rate Positioning**: 10% (build positions in Tier 1 candidates at 25% target size)

**Phase 1: Initial Activation (Fed Funds 3.5-4.0%, estimated Q2-Q3 2026)**

- High-Rate Champions: 60% (begin reducing as dispersion peaks)
- Transitional Strategies: 20% (maintain flexibility)
- Low-Rate Portfolio: 20% (activate BSX/HOV, PSEC/KIM, CHTR/THO at 50% target sizes)

Within Low-Rate Portfolio (20% total capital):
- BSX vs HOV: 10% (50% of allocation, building to target)
- PSEC vs KIM: 5% (monitoring credit quality)
- CHTR vs THO: 5% (monitoring RV shipment trends)

**Phase 2: Full Activation (Fed Funds 3.0-3.5%, estimated Q4 2026-Q1 2027)**

- High-Rate Champions: 40% (significant reduction as correlations compress)
- Transitional Strategies: 20% (maintain as hedge)
- Low-Rate Portfolio: 40% (full activation across all Tier 1 + selective Tier 2)

Within Low-Rate Portfolio (40% total capital):
- BSX vs HOV: 18% (full 15-20% range given highest conviction)
- PSEC vs KIM: 12% (full 10-15% if credit quality confirmed; otherwise substitute ARCC/MAIN)
- CHTR vs THO: 12% (full 10-15% as RV recovery materializes)
- TRU pair: 8% (once paired security identified)
- ARE alternative: 6% (with retail substitution)
- BEN alternative: 4% (lowest conviction given secular headwinds)

**Phase 3: Peak Low-Rate Environment (Fed Funds 2.5-3.0%, estimated 2027-2028)**

- High-Rate Champions: 20% (minimal—dispersion collapsed, correlations compressed)
- Transitional Strategies: 20% (defensive positioning)
- Low-Rate Portfolio: 60% (maximum allocation as regime fully establishes)

Maintain same internal weights but scale overall allocation. Monitor for signs of regime reversal.

### Warning signs that regime is shifting back to restrictive policy

**Primary indicators requiring immediate defensive action:**

1. **Fed Balance Sheet Expansion**: If QT restarts or balance sheet begins growing again above $7T, signals return to QE-lite regime. Begin reducing low-rate pairs immediately.

2. **Inflation Resurgence**: Core PCE above 3% for 2+ consecutive months with Fed hiking rhetoric. Historical precedent: 1970s-1980s multiple tightening cycles as inflation proved sticky.

3. **Correlation Compression Reversal**: DSPX falling below 25, sector correlation rising above 0.65, IC-RC spread widening above 10 points. Indicates dispersion collapsing—exit low-rate pairs, reload high-rate champions.

4. **VIX Term Structure Flattening**: Contango collapsing to <5% monthly, or backwardation persisting >5 days. Signals stress building, correlations will spike.

5. **Credit Spread Widening**: High-yield spreads widening >200bp above Treasuries despite falling rates. Indicates credit concerns overriding rate benefits—particularly dangerous for BDC pairs (PSEC).

6. **Cointegration Breakdown**: If 50%+ of low-rate pairs fail monthly Engle-Granger tests (p>0.10), regime relationships breaking. Stop deploying new capital, begin systematic exit.

7. **Housing Market Disconnect**: If mortgage rates fall but housing activity remains weak (NAHB index <50, existing home sales declining), suggests structural rather than cyclical issues. HOV pair loses fundamental support.

8. **RV Shipment Disappointment**: If RVIA shipments fail to recover despite rate cuts (remaining below 350K annually after 6 months of Fed Funds ≤3.5%), indicates permanent demand destruction. Exit THO pair.

**Systematic exit protocol when 3+ warning signs trigger:**

- Month 1: Close Tier 3 positions completely, reduce Tier 2 by 50%, reduce Tier 1 by 25%
- Month 2: Close remaining Tier 2, reduce Tier 1 by additional 50% (now at 25% of peak)
- Month 3: Close all low-rate positions, return to high-rate champion allocation framework

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

The 2015-2022 ZIRP environment created massive correlation compression as quantitative easing forced portfolio rebalancing across asset classes. **Cross-sector pairs that appeared cointegrated actually shared common dependence on unsustainable monetary policy** rather than fundamental economic linkages. When policy reversed at unprecedented speed (0% to 5.5% in 16 months), these relationships didn't just weaken—they broke permanently in many cases.

**Seven pairs merit consideration for regime-diversified portfolios, but only three achieve Tier 1 status:**

**TIER 1 CHAMPIONS:**
1. **BSX vs HOV** (9/10): Demographic cointegration through aging population, maximum HOV elasticity to rate normalization, BSX defensive hedge. **Begin scaling at 3.5% Fed Funds, full position at 3.0%. Target 15-20% of low-rate portfolio.**

2. **PSEC vs KIM** (7.5/10): Classic ZIRP income-vehicle relationship returns when "search for yield" resumes. Monitor PSEC credit quality carefully—consider ARCC/MAIN substitution. **Activate at 3.0% Fed Funds. Target 10-15% of low-rate portfolio.**

3. **CHTR vs THO** (7/10): Suburban lifestyle linkage genuine, RV recovery provides sharp elasticity. CHTR infrastructure value offers defensive characteristics despite 5G competition. **Monitor at 3.5%, activate at 3.0% Fed Funds. Target 10-15% of low-rate portfolio.**

**TIER 2 CONDITIONAL:**
4. TRU pair (6.5/10 pending paired security identification)
5. ARE with retail substitution (5.5/10 given biotech uncertainty)
6. BEN with construction materials alternative (5/10 given secular headwinds)

**TIER 3 AVOID:**
- VRSN vs CRI (CRI existential crisis)
- RKT vs HURN (unstable correlation)
- VISH vs CRI (misaligned cycles)
- FDXA vs AXP (terminated by merger)

**Implementation requires disciplined regime monitoring.** The current high-dispersion QT environment (DSPX ~36, sector correlation ~0.45, IC-RC spread 7 points) favors existing 2023-2025 champion strategies. **Maintain 70% allocation to current strategies until Fed Funds reaches 3.5%**, then begin systematic activation of low-rate pairs per the phased timeline.

**The key insight**: Statistical arbitrage profitability depends critically on regime classification. Simple correlation approaches achieve Sharpe ratios of 0.07-1.41. **Regime-switching strategies achieve 1.77-5.78. Lévy-driven regime models reach 3.92-11.47**—representing 50x improvement. The five-year period from 2015-2019 will not repeat exactly, but rate normalization to 2.5-3.5% Fed Funds creates similar opportunity structures. Pairs that survived ZIRP, broke during QT, and maintained fundamental cointegration represent the highest-conviction reactivation candidates.

**Begin building positions in BSX vs HOV when Fed Funds reaches 3.5%**—this pair offers the strongest fundamental linkage, maximum rate sensitivity elasticity, and defensive characteristics. The demographic inevitability of aging populations needing both retirement housing and medical devices provides multi-decade support independent of shorter-term rate cycles.
