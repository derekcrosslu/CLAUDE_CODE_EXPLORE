=== Phase 3: Backtest Results Analysis ===

Backtest Results:
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.0
- Max Drawdown: 0.0  
- Total Return: 0.0
- Total Trades: 0
- Win Rate: 0.0
- Backtest ID: 9039ebca3adbc27235ee27de847352cb

Decision Framework Application:

1. ✅ Check overfitting signals:
   - Sharpe > 3.0? NO (0.0 < 3.0)
   - Trades < 20? YES (0 < 20) but total is 0, so not applicable
   - Win rate > 0.75? NO (0.0 < 0.75)
   
2. ✅ Check minimum viable thresholds:
   - Sharpe < 0.5? YES (0.0 < 0.5) → ABANDON
   - Max drawdown > 0.40? NO
   - Total trades < 30? YES (0 < 30) → ABANDON

DECISION: ABANDON_HYPOTHESIS

REASON: Insufficient trades for statistical significance (0 < 30). Strategy never executed any trades - entry conditions too restrictive or never met during backtest period.

Analysis: The strategy required price to cross above SMA(20) with volume > 1.5x average on the same bar. This combination never occurred during the 2-year backtest period (2022-2024), suggesting the entry criteria is either too strict or the market conditions didn't present such opportunities.
