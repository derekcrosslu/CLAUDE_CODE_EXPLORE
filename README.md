# QuantConnect Autonomous Strategy Development

**Goal**: Build a lean, self-documenting workflow enabling Claude Code to autonomously develop and validate QuantConnect trading strategies session-after-session.

## 🚀 Start Here

```bash
cat PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION/CORE/SETUP/NEXT_STEPS/CURRENT_STATUS.md
```

**Everything you need is in that ONE file.**

---

## 🔑 Critical Rule

**NEVER create status/documentation files at root level.**

Only these files allowed at root:
- README.md (this file - points to real documentation)
- requirements.txt
- .env
- .gitignore

Everything else goes in PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION/
