# Debug notes for Monte Carlo fix

## Issue: 0 trades generated

Likely causes:
1. qb.History() returns multi-index DataFrame - need to handle correctly
2. Accessing 'close' may need different syntax
3. May need to reset_index() or handle the DataFrame structure

## QuantConnect History DataFrame structure:
- Multi-index: (symbol, time)
- Columns: open, high, low, close, volume
- Need to access: hist['close'] or hist.close for single symbol

## Fix needed:
Replace:
  long_hist['close']

With one of:
  long_hist['close'] if hist is already sliced by symbol
  OR hist.close if single symbol
  OR need to check what qb.History actually returns

## Test approach:
Add debug cell to print:
- type(long_hist)
- long_hist.head()
- long_hist.columns
- long_hist.index

This will show exact structure.
